	<h2>Independent Project Proposal<h2>
	<h3>Project Name<span>&#58;</span> Digital Portfolio Redesign<h3>
	<h3>Project Overview<span>&#58;</span><h3>
	<p>The project I am choosing to complete for my Independent assignment is a complete redesign of my digital portfolio.
	I am very disappointed with how my portfolio looks at this moment in time. I am looking forward to taking full advantage of
	this oppurtunity to revamp and redesign my entire portfolio. My first step is to recategorize all of my projects into new categories
	that fit UI/UX and Visual Design better. The new cateogories I want to to establish is an about me page, coding projects, user research projects,
	visual design projects, and written works. I will also be improving the content of my included projects as well to 
	make sure my portfolio looks as professional as possible.</p>
	<h3>Audience<span>&#58;</span><h3>
	<p>The target audience for this project is mainly future employers. I really want my portfolio to represent me in a way that makes
		it well-known to employers that I have knowledge and expertise involving UI/UX work.</p>
	<h3>Timeline<span>&#58;</span><h3>
	<p>February 13th to February 19th<span>&#58;</span> Establish an about me page and complete the coding projects page.</p>
	<p>February 20th to February 25th<span>&#58;</span> Create and finalize user research projects and visual design projects.</p>
	<p>Febraury 26th to March 3rd<span>&#58;</span> Implement written works page and make sure portfolio is perfect<p>
